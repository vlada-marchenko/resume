# My Online Resume

This repo contains the code for my online resume, which lives here:

I wanted a version of my CV that isn’t just a PDF attachment – something that looks good on any device, is easy to share, and is simple for me to keep up to date.

## What this project is

It’s a small, static website that:

- shows my experience, education, skills and contacts in a clean layout;
- works on both desktop and mobile (responsive layout);
- loads quickly and doesn’t rely on anything heavy or complicated.
